# Pilot's Dashboard: Tactical Buildout 

We have successfully transformed the Peacock Engine into a high-performance industrial engineering rig. This buildout lays a "solid ass foundation" for multi-threaded strike orchestration and granular payload management.

## 🚁 New Tactical Modules

````carousel
### 1. Context Vault (Ammo Management)
The right sidebar now features the **Context Vault**. You can move assets from your **Ammo Pile** (server-side storage) directly into your **Loaded Payload**. Clicking **EDIT** on any asset slides out the **Prompt Editor** for immediate grooming.

### 2. Sequence Striker (10 Slots)
The heartbeat of the pilot's dashboard. Define a 10-slot manifest with individual model and key settings. 
- **Master Arm**: A safety toggle that must be engaged before sequences can fire.
- **Threading Modes**:
    - **Ultra Mode**: Maintains continuous pressure—as soon as one strike lands, the next fires.
    - **Batch Mode**: Fires waves of N threads and waits for the full batch before proceeding.

### 3. Pilot Gauges (Real-Time Telemetry)
Industrial gauges at the bottom of the sidebar visualize system throughput:
- **Token Burn (TPS)**: Real-time tokens per second during active sequences.
- **Pressure (RPM)**: System load measured in requests per minute.

## 🛠️ Architecture Updates

- **[SequenceOrchestrator.ts](file:///home/flintx/peacock-engine/ui/src/lib/SequenceOrchestrator.ts)**: A custom engine that handles worker-pool logic for "Ultra" mode and chunking logic for "Batch" mode.
- **Filesystem Bridge**: Expanded `PeacockAPI` with full CRUD for your ammo assets.
- **Sand Hill UI Hardening**: Integrated Geist and Outfit typography with neon-glow kinetics and industrial icons.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

To manifest this build on your VPS:
1. `git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main`
2. `cd ui && npm run build`
3. `cd .. && ./launch.sh`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Threading Warning**: Running 10 threads in **Ultra Mode** can drain your key pools rapidly. Ensure your "Master Arm" is only active when your targets are locked.

**Build Status: STABLE (v4.5.0-PHANTOM)**
**Foundation: SOLID**
